## Homework 1 (due Sunday, April 3rd at 11:59PM) 📝

**Welcome to your first DSC 90 homework!** Homeworks in DSC 90 are designed to have you engage with the week's content. They will rely on you having completed the readings.

Homeworks in DSC 90 are distributed via Jupyter Notebook. They contain a mix of reflection, mathematical, and programming questions. You will always submit your homework as a **PDF**, not a Jupyter Notebook. The homework notebook will specify what you need to include in your PDF writeup.

We encourage you to discuss the readings and questions with others in the course, but all work must be your own. **Remember to use Slack if you need guidance!**

<br>

The Homework 1 notebook will be linked here by noon on Tuesday, March 29th.
