## Homework 7 (due Sunday, May 15th at 11:59PM)

There is no new "Homework 7." Instead, this week, you can make up **one** earlier homework that you didn't receive full credit on, whether that's because you submitted an incomplete homework or didn't submit a homework at all. We just ask that you do not look at the solutions while re-doing old homework problems. 

There is no Gradescope submission portal; instead, message Suraj on Slack with your updated/completed old homework.

**Whether or not you need to make up an old homework, you should still complete the readings linked above.**
