    "\n",
    "Recall, in lecture we considered an example where we flipped a coin 10 times and saw the sequence HTTHTTTTTH. For an arbitrary bias $p$, the probability of that sequence is $p^3 (1-p)^7$. However, $p^3 (1-p)^7$ is **not** the probability of seeing 3 heads and 7 tails. To compute that, we'd need to consider all of the different orders in which we could see 3 heads and 7 tails – for example, HHHTTTTTTT, HTHTHTTTTT, etc. Each of these orderings has the same probability, $p^3 (1-p)^7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $P(\\text{3 heads, 7 tails}) = (\\text{# of ways of flipping 3 heads and 7 tails}) \\cdot p^3 (1-p)^7$. As you will learn in DSC 40A (if you haven't already), the number of ways of flipping 3 heads and 7 tails is ${10 \\choose 3}$, pronounced \"10 choose 3\". If you're not familiar with this notation, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j2mFGkvwWE) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR6FeO5Pgss).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general probability distribution we've discussed here is called the **binomial distribution**, which determines the probability of seeing $k$ successes in $n$ trials of an experiment in which each trial succeeds with probability $p$, independent of all other trials. It says that the probability of $k$ successes is\n",

    "$$P(\\text{$k$ successes}) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Each time I call my grandma, she answers the phone with probability 0.6. I call her 5 times. What is more likely – her answering twice, or her answering four times? Find the probability of both events. Write out both answers symbolically, and then use a calculator to evaluate them as decimals. If you'd like to use this notebook to evaluate the result as a decimal, the function `comb(n, k)` in the Python package `scipy.special` (imported below) calculates ${n \\choose k}$."
