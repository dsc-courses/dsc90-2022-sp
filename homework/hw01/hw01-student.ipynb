    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer:** This question looks long, but the amount of work you'll have to do is relatively minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Archimedes' approximation for the value of $\\pi$ used the fact that the ratio between the circumference of a circle and the diameter of that circle is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are given that $\\pi$ is also equal to the ratio between the **area** of a circle and the **square of the radius of that circle**. (This is not a trivial fact, but we will use it without proof for now.) What if we try to estimate $\\pi$ using this fact, instead? That is, what if we inscribe regular polygons with more and more sides inside a circle with radius $r = 1$, and estimate $\\pi$ with\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi \\approx \\frac{\\text{Area of regular n-gon}}{r^2} = \\text{Area of regular n-gon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The term \"$n$-gon\" refers to a polygon with $n$ sides.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, as our inscribed polygon has more and more sides, it looks more and more like a circle, so its area should approach the area of the circle. (This is not a fully rigorous argument, but it will suffice for our purposes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from lecture, if $s_1$ is the side length of a regular $n$-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 and $s_2$ is the side length of a regular $2n$-gon inscribed in the same circle, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_2 = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{s_1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{s_1}{2}\\right)^2} \\right)^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(This formula is implemented by `next_sidelength(s)` in the code for this week's lecture.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have this formula, we're already able to calculate the side length of a regular $n$-gon for any value of $n$ in the sequence (6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, ...), which are the same polygons we'll continue to look at. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's switch our focus to calculating the area of a given inscribed $n$-gon. Let's supppose our $n$-gon has side length $s$. Then, one way to calculate its area is to split the $n$-gon into $n$ isoceles triangles, each of which have two sides of length $r = 1$ and one side of length $s$. What we then need to do is find the area of one of these isoceles triangles and multiply it by $n$.\n",

    "In the image above, the blue polygon is a dodecagon, a regular polygon with 12 sides. If we find the area of triangle OAB and multiply it by 12, we'll get the area of the dodecagon. (Similarly, if we found the area of the orange triangle and multiplied it by 24, we'd get the area of the inscribed 24-sided polygon. Note that the orange triangle also has two sides of length 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the area of triangle OAB, we need to multiply its base (which we know to be 1) by its height, which we've denoted as $h$ in the diagram above, and divide the result by 2. Our problem now lies in determining what $h$ is, in terms of $s$. (Remember, for any value of $n$, we can find $s$ using `next_sidelength` repeatedly.)"
