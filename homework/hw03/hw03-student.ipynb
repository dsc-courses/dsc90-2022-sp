    "\n",
    "King Triton, UCSD's mascot, has come up with a new way of measuring time. His new time format, called Triton Time, is well-suited to describing periods of time relative to the academic quarter, which is 10 weeks long.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='https://www.ucsandiegotenniscamps.com/images/ContactLogo15.jpg' width=100></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "He defines the units of Triton Time as follows:\n",
    "- 1 Triton Degree (TD) is equal to 10 weeks\n",
    "- 1 Triton Minute (TM) is equal to 1/10th of a TD\n",
    "- 1 Triton Second (TS) is equal to 1/7th of a TM\n",
    "- 1 Triton Nanosecond (TN) is equal to 1/48th of a TS\n",
    "\n",
    "Times in Triton Time are specified in ordered quadruplets, starting with a T. For example, $T(2, 1, 4, 3)$ corresponds to 2 TD + 1 TM + 4 TS + 3 TN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2.1\n",
    "Convert $T(4, 3, 2, 5)$ to regular days, hours, and minutes (e.g. \"$a$ days,  $b$ hours, and $c$ minutes\", where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are whole numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2.2\n",
    "Convert $79 + \\frac{7}{48}$ days into Triton Time. That is, specify your answer as $T(a, b, c, d)$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are whole numbers. Make sure to confirm your answer by converting it back into days.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint:*** Look closely at the definitions of each of the four components of Triton Time – the denominators might seem familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Triton Time is not nearly as fine-grained as our regular method of measuring time. What is the level of precision of Triton Time?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your answer is \"one minute\", you're saying that it's possible to pick two times that are exactly one regular minute apart and specify them both with different Triton Times, but it is not possible to do this with any amount of regular time less than one minute."
